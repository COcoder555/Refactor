# My Adjustments

* I introduced Semantic HTML and replaced div where possible:
    * Changed the div on line 12 and 28 to header.
    * Changed the div on line 31 and 40 to article.
    * Changed the div on line 42 and 51 to article.

    * Changed the div on line 66 and 73 to article.
    * Changed the div on line 83 and 90 to article.
    * Changed the div on line 92 and 97 to footer.


* I simplified the CSS code in the style.css file
    * Created a singular class "BOB" so that all the sections with matching CSS properties could be targeted in single class.
    * Created a singular class "benefit" so athat all the asides with matching CSS properties could be targted in a single class.
    
* I added alt attributes to all the images and a title attribute to meet accessibility standards:
    * added alt atttribute to image on line 32.

    * added alt attribute to image on line 54.
    * added title attribute to image in "hero" class on line 30.

* I changed the title element to "Horiseon Social Solutions landing page."

    * Changed the h4 to an h3 on line 45.
    * Changed the h5 to an h4 on line 84.
    * Changed the h6 to an h5 on line 93.
